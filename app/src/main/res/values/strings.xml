    <string name="about_section">Let\'s face it - studying is boring.\n\n

No one likes to memorize tons of information and then just forget it all in a couple of days.
What if there was a more fun way to learn COMPLETELY useless and a billion times more interesting stuff?
Once you learn that Eiffel Tower was sold twice, or that the fastest MMA knockout of all time happened
in only 2 seconds, you will have trouble EVER forgetting that.\n\n

Well, we had the idea to make a game just like that. Educate yourself on various subjects,
find out almost everything about almost everything and have fun while doing so.
\'2Facts1Fake\' is not just a game, it\'s your way of becoming the annoying \'know-it-all\' guy,
the always interesting \'did-you-know\' guy and ultimately the winner of \'Who wants to be a millionaire\'.\n\n

It contains more than 1500 random facts, hand picked and thoroughly checked. More are added every day
to our always growing database of knowledge, and we are proud to say that one of two developers who
spent more time finding facts is now significantly smarter than the other one. We\'ll keep it a secret
which one it is, but let\'s just say he also wrote the About section (and didn\'t let the other one read it).\n\n

Anyway, the objective of the game is to click on one of 3 sentences, that you think is most likely to be fake.
Some of the fake ones are simply exaggerated true facts, but some are pure fiction of the developers.
That\'s it, pretty simple. To make it a little bit more challenging, we added the time constraint.
Also on incorrect answer, you\'ll get -5 seconds, and +10 on correct answer.\n\n

The core point of the game is not to have 1 million points, it\'s to learn and to be amazed by some of the facts.
You will surely have a need to check some of those facts on the Internet after playing, and we strongly
encourage that. We had so much fun while making the game, we literally annoyed our parents, friends and
girlfriends with random facts we learned that day.\n\n

The game was made by:
	Milan Vucic - vucic94@yahoo.com
	Nebojsa Urosevic - nebojsa94urosevic@gmail.com\n\n

Game designer and a young perspective architect:
	Vasilije Glavas - vasilijemg@yahoo.com\n\n

Hope you enjoy the game, and if you do, rate it honestly. If you don\'t, please give us a feedback
on how to make it better and more enjoyable. We\'re always open for suggestions of any kind,
so feel free to send us an email with whatever questions you have.\n\n
