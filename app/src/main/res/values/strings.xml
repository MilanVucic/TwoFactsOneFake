    <string name="about_section">This game was made about 3 years ago by me and my friend. At that time we didn\'t know Android
        and this app was our "learning" project. When it was done, we got an internship thanks to it, so all that work wasn\'t in vain.
        After that, we started learning other languages and frameworks and the game was forgotten for a long time. Having had a bit of spare time,
        I decided to bring it back to life and upload it, since even though it looks god awful, it contains some pretty interesting questions.
        \n
        \n
        It is quite obvious at this stage that the game needs a LOT of work on it, but both my friend and I didn\'t have time to completely redo it
        from scratch, so I just fixed it up a little bit so it\'s playable, and if it has enough downloads it will get a full revamp soon.

        \n\n

        Please do not hesitate to contact us with your suggestions.

The game was made by:
	Milan Vucic - vucic94@yahoo.com
	Nebojsa Urosevic - nebojsa94urosevic@gmail.com\n\n
